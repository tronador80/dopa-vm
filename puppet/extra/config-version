#!/bin/bash
# Prior to each Puppet run, Puppet will invoke this script to determine the
# configuration version. This script will generate a version string of the
# format 'NNNNNNNNNN.XXXXXXX', where 'NNN..' is the current UTC UNIX time and
# 'XXX..' is the short SHA1 hash of the HEAD commit of MediaWiki-Vagrant.
#
# If no Git info is available (as would happen if MediaWiki-Vagrant was
# obtained via a tarball, rather than git-clone), the second field is set to
# 'no-git'.
#
# Puppet uses the configuration version as a label for its log output.
# Including the timestamp and commit in the version makes it easier to
# correlate logs to specific changes.
#
# For more information, see the Puppet manual:
# <http://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/latest/configuration.html#configversion>
#
